> About this project

This project (InEx-plus) is currently 'UNDER DEVELOPMENT'. The objective of this project is to develope a 'Simple' yet having all the 'Significant Featured' CLI based 'Income and Expense Management' app. I am trying my best to develope it as good as possible because my previous project (InEx-app) is a big failure, and I am trying to avoid all the mistakes I did earlier in that project.

Feedbacks and suggestions are welcome. you can also report bugs in your convenient way.
